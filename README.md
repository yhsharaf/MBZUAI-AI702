> **Abstract:** *Point-interactive image colorization aims to colorize grayscale images when a user provides the colors for specific locations. It is essential for point-interactive colorization methods to appropriately propagate user-provided colors (i.e., user hints) in the entire image to obtain a reasonably colorized image with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce partially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking convolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address this problem, we present iColoriT, a novel point-interactive colorization Vision Transformer capable of propagating user hints to relevant regions, leveraging the global receptive field of Transformers. The self-attention mechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant regions with only a few local hints. Our approach colorizes images in real-time by utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces the decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by pixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing layer. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach highly outperforms existing methods for point-interactive colorization, producing accurately colorized images with a user's minimal effort.*

## Testing

### Installation

Our code is implemented in Python 3.8, torch>=1.8.2
```
git clone https://github.com/pmh9960/iColoriT.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing iColoriT

You can generate colorization results when iColoriT is provided with randomly selected groundtruth hints from color images. 
Please fill in the path to the model checkpoints and validation directories in the scripts/infer.sh file.

```
bash scripts/infer.sh
```

Then, you can evaluate the results by running

```
bash scripts/eval.sh
```
Randomly sampled hints used in our paper is available in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MVU5Ze5FbT0Kp14bJcfDANY17lgkNmwn/view?usp=sharing)

The codes used for randomly sampling hint locations can be seen in hint_generator.py

## Training

First prepare an official ImageNet dataset with the following structure. 

```
train
 â”” id1
   â”” image1.JPEG
   â”” image2.JPEG
   â”” ...
 â”” id2
   â”” image1.JPEG
   â”” image2.JPEG
   â”” ...     

```

Please fill in the train/evaluation directories in the scripts/train.sh file and execute

```
bash scripts/train.sh
```
